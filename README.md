Solihiya is a parametric pavillion configurator based from the philippine sunburst weaving pattern of the same name. The aim of the configurator is to the give users feedback on implications of different parametric configurations to the pavilion like height, openings, and solar parameters. This also gives users insight on different shadow patterns and behaviours depending on vectors got from solar angles and times of day.

The Solihiya project is based from the Filipino traditional weaving pattern called solihiya. And the goal of the configurator is to create a pavilion with varying openings that responds to light and solar angles The configurator has simple parameters that could control solar directions that is an attractor for opening variation in the shell pattern User strings are attached to the mesh that shows a rainbow gradient corresponding to attractor distance. There are also parameter sliders that control height and size of the smallest and largest openings You could also download the preferred geometry as an .obj format mesh geometry

# _PROJECT BRIEF
- SOLIHIYA
- The browser-based configurator is based from the Filipino traditional weaving pattern called solihiya. 
The configurator defines a pavilion with varying openings that responds to light and solar angles
Solar Directions can be controlled by simple parameter sliders and serves as an attractor for pattern opening variations.
A color gradient is applied to mesh edges corresponding to the variety of attractor distances.
There are also parameter sliders that control height, and size of the smallest and largest openings
It is also possible to download the geometry as a mesh geometry in .obj format
