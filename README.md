# _PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Solihiya is a parametric pavillion configurator based from the Philippine sunburst weaving pattern of the same name. 
The aim of the configurator is to the give users feedback on implications of different parametric configurations to the pavilion like height, openings, and solar parameters. This also gives users insight on different shadow patterns and behaviours depending on vectors got from solar angles and times of day. A color gradient is applied to the mesh edges of the pavillion corresponding to the distance from the sun.

The Solihiya project is based from the Filipino traditional weaving pattern called solihiya. And the goal of the configurator is to create a pavilion with varying openings that responds to light and solar angles The configurator has simple parameters that could control solar directions that is an attractor for opening variation in the shell pattern User strings are attached to the mesh that shows a rainbow gradient corresponding to attractor distance. There are also parameter sliders that control height and size of the smallest and largest openings You could also download the preferred geometry as an .obj format mesh geometry
