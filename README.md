The Solihiya project is based from the Filipino traditional weaving pattern called solihiya. And the goal of the configurator is to create a pavilion with varying openings that responds to light and solar angles The configurator has simple parameters that could control solar directions that is an attractor for opening variation in the shell pattern User strings are attached to the mesh that shows a rainbow gradient corresponding to attractor distance. There are also parameter sliders that control height and size of the smallest and largest openings You could also download the preferred geometry as an .obj format mesh geometry
