# _PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Solihiya is a parametric pavilion configurator based from the Philippine sunburst weaving pattern of the same name. 
The aim of the configurator is to the give users feedback on implications of different parametric configurations to the pavilion like height, openings, and solar parameters. This also gives users insight on different shadow patterns and behaviours depending on vectors got from solar angles and times of day. A color gradient is applied to the mesh edges of the pavilion corresponding to the distance from the sun.

# _INSTRUCTIONS
The Webapp is

Parameters:  
Format: (ParamName) - (Name),(Description); (DomainValueMin, DomainValueMax)  

zHeight - Moves the height of the pavillion; (0,250)  
solAngle - solar angle, Move the altitude angle of the sun; (1,179)  
toD - time of day, Moves the sun along the curve path; (1,9)  
smlOpening - Small opening, Modifies the size of the small opening of the pavilion; (0,45)  
lrgOpening - Large opening, Modifies the size of the large opening of the pavilion; (0,45)
